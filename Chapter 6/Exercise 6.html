<!--Petrol Calculator ☑️
Create a simple petrol calculator. Your petrol calculator must include:

A field for the user the enter the cost of petrol per liter. This should have a default value of 1.72
A field for the user to enter the number of liters purchased. This should have a default value of 0
A button that when clicked calculates the total cost of the petrol purchased and displays the result to the screen
A p tag to display the total cost
Comments throughout every file.
Buttons should include hover effects, and fields should clearly "focus" when in use.
Clean and professional creative styling.-->

                <!-- Not entirely sure of the process here but what I believe is happening is that the id "total" is overwritten by the values of ids "no1" and "no2"
                being multiplied together once the petroltotal() function is called respectively, so the content in the "total" is displayed regardless of whether something is between 
                the div tags. This is seen in the JS file, which I will comment on.-->
