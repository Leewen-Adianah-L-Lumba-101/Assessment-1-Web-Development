<!--Alan Partridge Soundboard (Bonus - Optional)
A local comedy radio show needs you to develop an audio soundboard for them. The soundboard will display a grid of Alan Partridge samples. When a sample is clicked the associated audio file will play. The audio samples for this exercise are located in Exercises/Audio Sampler. Your sampler must:

Include all of the samples in the Audio Sampler directory;
Display all samples on a single non-scrolling page;
Make use of correct semantic markup;
Display the correct sample name;
Change the colour of the background, and text, when the user hovers over a sample;
Include index.html, style.css and index.js files;
Include creative styling for your background, sample buttons, fonts and hover effects;
Use the below example as a reference:

        <title>Alan's Soundboard</title>
        <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "External Stylesheet Soundboard.css">
        <script src = "Audio Playback.js"></script>
    </head>

        <h1>ALAN PARTRIDGE SOUNDBOARD</h1>
        <div class = "wrap">
            <!--I am aware that there should be a separate file for Javascript, I could not get the function to work with multiple ids.
            When you use a function, you require a parameter, but what kind of parameter do I give? I can't just use the getElementById
            in that function because the id for every audio file is unique, that cannot be given empty text either either, it would not
            execute the file correctly. I find it frustrating and I don't have enough knowledge or creativity to execute my idea. 
            I scrapped the external script entirely; I made an attempt previously, but each button only played the first audio, 
            so I cannot settle for that in my exercise. You can see the remnants of my attempt on line 18.-->
