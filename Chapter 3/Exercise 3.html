<!--Three images ☑️
In a new index.html file display three images (that you would be legally allowed to use for a commercial project) and do the following:

Select a theme which ties all three images together.
Give each image an appropriate alt attribute.
Give each image appropriate width and height attributes (retaining its original aspect ratio).
Give each image an appropriate title attribute.
Use CSS filters to change the appearance of all three of your images.
Ensure each image is under 300kb.
Underneath each image, provide information on its copyright license.
