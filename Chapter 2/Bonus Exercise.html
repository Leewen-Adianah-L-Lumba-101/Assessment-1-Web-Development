          <h2>Key Facts and Interesting Tidbits!</h2>
          It's important to note that the movie is a work of fiction, but inspired by a real historical time period. This is set
          in 1858, an age in pre-Civil War South America notorious for the movement of slave trading. All characters are not related to any actual, real human persons
          or real events but inspired by their time sensitive elements.

             <dd>A mistake in Django Unchained involves the several usages of dynamite onscreen, despite it being invented in 1867,
                 9 years after the time setting.</dd>
