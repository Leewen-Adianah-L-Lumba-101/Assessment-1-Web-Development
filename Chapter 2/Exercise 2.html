<!--One-page website ☑️
Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:

An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find.
A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked.
Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
At least two classes.
One link styled as a button.

<html>
    <title>DJANGO UNCHAINED</title>
    <head>
        <!--The link tag helps define the relationship of this internal file to an external source, in this instance, a CSS file.
        'href' is an attribute that specifies the location of the file, since it's in the same directory as this file, we just need 
        the name of the file.-->

          <h2>Key Facts and Interesting Tidbits!</h2>
          It's important to note that the movie is a work of fiction, but inspired by a real historical time period. This is set
          in 1858, an age in pre-Civil War South America notorious for the movement of slave trading. All characters are not related to any actual, real human persons
          or real events but inspired by their time sensitive elements.

             <dd>A mistake in Django Unchained involves the several usages of dynamite onscreen, despite it being invented in 1867,
                 9 years after the time setting.</dd>
