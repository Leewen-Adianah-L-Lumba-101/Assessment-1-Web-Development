         <strong>Batter: </strong>
         <li>In a bowl, beat the 1/4th cup of softened butter (making sure the butter is room temperature) 
             with 2/3rds of granulated sugar until the mixture is light in colour. </li>
         <li>Then, whisk in the 1 tbsp of oil until it's fully dissolved.</li>
         <li>Crack an egg open and continue beating until the batter is fluffy.</li>
         <li>Once fluffy, pour in 6 tbsps of milk along with 1 tbsp of vanilla extract (as usual, continue mixing).</li>
         <li>In second bowl, mix 1/4th cup of flour, 1/4th tbsp of baking soda, 1/2 tbsp of baking powder 
             and 1/4th tbsp of salt together. </li>
         <li>Once mixed, add the second bowl to the first bowl, then whisk continously until all the lumps are gone. </li>

         <br>

         <strong>Filling:</strong>
         <li>In a saucepan at medium low heat, cook the 600-700g of frozen strawberries until the juices have seeped out.</li>
         <li>Add the 1 tbsp of lemon/lime juice, then add 1-2 tbsp(s) of sugar to taste.</li>
         <li>Stir well, then let it simmer until the filling has slightly thickened.</li>
         <li>Once at the desired texture, sprinkle in the 2 tbsps of flour.</li>
         <li>Stir until dissolved. Once done, turn the stove off and let it cool.</li>

         <br>

         <strong>Crumb:</strong>
         <li>Chop 2 tbps of solid, cold butter on a cutting board.</li>
         <li>In a new bowl, add 1/4th cup of flour, 1/4th cup of brown sugar and 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon.</li>
         <li>It's advisable to mix this with your hands, if not a spatula. Add in the chopped butter pieces.</li>

         <br>

         <strong>Assembly:</strong>
         <li>Preheat the oven to 175°c.</li>
         <li>Prepare preferred baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
         <li>Add half of the batter into the lined pan, using a clean spatula to evenly spread it.</li>
         <li>Add the filling made previously, using a spatula again to have an equal spread.</li>
         <li>Pour 4 tbsps of milk into the remaining batter and mix well.</li>
         <li>Pour the mixed batter left on top of the filling layer.</li>
         <li>With a chopstick or thin appliance, make swirling patterns on the baking pan.</li>
         <li>Then, when enough swirls are made to your liking, add the crumb mix on top evenly.</li>
         <li>Bake the cake inside the oven for ~45 minutes.</li>
         <li>Occassionally, check with a toothpick to test if certain parts of the cake have been baked (adjust the time
             to 2 or more minutes if desired).
         <li>Once finished, let the cake cool for 15 minutes then serve.</li>
         <li>Enjoy!</li>
