                    <dt><code>htmL</code></dt>
                    <dd>In any sketchbook or program dedicated to multiple high level languages, the tag specifies the file you save the code as as html.
                         Or, if you have multiple instances of programming languages in the same file, the tag helps classify which sections are in html
                         (although that might be redundant, as it's better grouping code in one particular section rather than making multiple sections).</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt><code>head</code></dt>
                    <dd>The head tag concerns the metadata of a website, the unstructured data in a website; things like keywords for the 
                         type of content inside the html site or the title of the tab. (Example: if your site is a business website, the head tag
                         will include it's specificities, is it for a company or a standalone educational website?)</dd>

                    <dt><code>style</code></dt>
                    <dd>The style tag is a means to introduce CSS styling into your HTML document. Anything between the opening and closing tag are
                         considered CSS code, this uses a different syntax than HTML (internal styling). This word can be put within a tag as well and can 
                         also be used for inline styling.</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt><code>body</code></dt></li>
                    <dd>As the name suggests, this contains everything inside the HTML document. (Note: Styling an entire document would be easier if everything 
                         were to be inside this tag).</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt><code>h1-h6</code></dt>
                    <dd>These are called Heading tags and in their most basic format highlight the headings of a webpage. The different font sizes are in descending order
                         with the "h1" tag being the largest size. Every Heading tag is typically with a large font, this stands out from the body text and is styled 'bold'.</dd>
                    <br>

                    <dt><code>em</code></dt>
                    <dd>A format tag used to make the content within the tags (text-based content) in the italics style.</dd>

                    <dt><code>p</code></dt>
                    <dd>This is the paragraph tag. When used continously, the content between the tags are spaced with blank lines and treated like paragraphs.</dd>

                    <dd>This is a kind of classification or grouping function, it's useful for external and internal styling and can change

        <h4>CSS</h4>
        <h3>Example 1</h3>
        <span class = "column" id = "code">
         h1 {
             font-family: "Anton", sans-serif;
             font-weight: 500;
             letter-spacing: 3;
             font-size: 35;
            }
        </span>

        <br>
        <div class = "column">
            This is an example of CSS code responsible for styling the h1 tag. Styling html tags are possible this way and are a
            direct alteration (what I consider 'indirect' is using class and ids). This overwrites or adds on to the properties
            of what the h1 tag provides by default. The next time a <code>h1</code> tag is used again, it will have the following.
        

            <br><br>

            An unstyled h1 tag would look like this:
            <h1 id = "ogh1">Resource Guide</h1>
        </div>

        <br>
        <h3>Breakdown</h3>
        <br>

        <div class = "row">

            <div class = "column" id = "code">font-family: "Anton", sans-serif; </div>
            <div class = "column">
             This changes the font of text in the HTML document when called. The font name is "Anton" and is wrapped in quotations 
             (Note: Font names require the whitespace inbetween; like calling upon another family like "Comic Sans MS"), this is the first 
             arguement taken by the property. The second arguement 'sans-serif' works as a keyword and specifies what kind of style the 
             alphabets/characters the font would have (sans, cursive, monospace, etc.)
            </div>
        
            <br />

            <div class = "column" id = "code">font-weight: 500;</div>
            <div class = "column">
                 A simple property that changes the thickness of the letters in the text. 
                 The higher the value, the bolder the letters.
            </div>

            <br />

            <div class = "column" id = "code">letter-spacing: 3;</div>
            <div class = "column">
                 This property is self-explanatory and increases or decreases the spacing inbetween letters.
            </div>

            <br />

            <div class = "column" id = "code">font-size: 35;</div>    
                <div class = "column">
                This changes the size of the font.
            </div>
        </div>

        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>

        <h3>Example 2</h3>
        <br>

        <span class = "column" id = "code">
         .column {
             text-align: justify;
             float: left;
             width: 45%;
             padding: 20px;
            }
        </span>

        <br>
        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">
             This is an example of a 'class'. It has properties that edits the space a content would be inside of. This can supply 
             changes to multiple elements in an HTML document, keeping them in the same format/container. Especially important when keeping
             consistency in a website.<br>
            </div>

            <br />
            <h3 style = "transform: translateX(-49%);">Breakdown</h3>
            <br>

            <span class = "column" id = "code">text-align: justify;</span>
            <div class = "column">
                Changes the horizontal alignment of text with justify, center, left or right.
            </div>

            <br />

            <span class = "column" id = "code">float: left;</span>
            <div class = "column">
                This property can be similar to alignment types, with left or right but with an additional 'none' arguement.
                When content is added into an HTML doc, it takes up horizontal space along with it's vertical height 
                due to it's default container. Float allows elements and text to wrap around the content. This kind of
                formatting property is useful in keeping relevant information next to each other and reducing extra white space.
            </div>

            <br />

            <span class = "column" id = "code">width: 45%;</span>
            <div class = "column">
                Changes the width of a content's container, anything exceeding the limit set by the user will be added to the next line.
            </div>

            <br />

            <span class = "column" id = "code">padding: 20px;</span>
            <div class = "column">
                Padding concerns the space between the container and the content inside it. It can be useful when spacing content 
                next to other content.
            </div>

                Extra: To do External Styling, make sure to include this code in your <code>head</code> section.

                (It's also advisable to have the CSS file in the same directory as your HTML document.)
